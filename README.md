ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning. The model is trained on the famous Iris dataset, which consists of three flower species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The goal is to classify an iris flower based on its sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

ðŸ—‚ Dataset
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples with 4 numerical features.
Each sample belongs to one of three species:
ðŸŒº Iris Setosa
ðŸŒ¿ Iris Versicolor
ðŸŒ¸ Iris Virginica
The dataset is available in Scikit-Learn and can also be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
